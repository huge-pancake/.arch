I've been a lost soul
When somebody falls
I go and follow them down
Ya I've been impatient
Thought I was owed some kind of greatness
By now

All the darkest days
Will come and go
They come and go
And the silver linings they'll be golden

I know the world has a heartbeat
Cause I found it somewhere inside me
Tell me do you feel it too-oo, oo oo
Tell me do you feel it

Where does my mind go
It's running away
Somewhere I don't know
At all
I wanna listen
Shut out the noise
Letting the rhythm
Go on

All the darkest days
Will come and go
They come and go
And the silver linings they'll be golden

I know the world has a heartbeat
Cause I found it somewhere inside me
Tell me do you feel it too-oo, oo oo
Tell me do you feel it

All the darkest days
Will come and go
They come and go
And the silver linings they'll be golden

I know the world has a heartbeat
Cause I found it somewhere inside me
Tell me do you feel it too-oo, oo oo
Tell me do you feel it
Tell me do you feel it
Tell me do you feel it
